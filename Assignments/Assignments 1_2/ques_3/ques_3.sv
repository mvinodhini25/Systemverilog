Why can’t we use a foreach loop for popping all the elements in a
queue?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER :
should not use foreach to pop all elements from a queue because 
foreach is designed to iterate over the queue's elements using its 
indices, while pop_front() or pop_back() changes the queue size and
indices during the loop.
